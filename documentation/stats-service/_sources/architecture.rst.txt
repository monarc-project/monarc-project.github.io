Architecture
============

High level architecture 
-----------------------

   :alt: Organization level


MONARC clients hosted on FO1 and FO2 push regularly stats about risk analysis to
a local Stats Service instance (dashboard.my.monarc.lu).

A company has the possibility to `push stats <command-line-interface.html#pushing-data>`_
from selected clients with the same
account on, for example, dashboard.monarc.lu. The service behind dashboard.monarc.lu
is operated by CASES Luxembourg and aims to provide relevant data about the
current cybersecurity trends, focused in the Luxembourg area.



Examples
--------

These following diagrams presents the idea behind the decentralized nature
of the Stats Service API.


Scenario 1
''''''''''

.. image:: _static/architecture-stats-scenario1.png
   :alt: Stats Service API interaction with MONARC

The Stats Service is installed on a dedicated server, gathering stats sent by the
front office (FO). It can also return the aggregated stats to the MONARC backend (FO)
for the dashboard of the MONARC users (with the CEO role).

.. note::

    The Stats Service only communicates with the backend of MONARC thanks to
    :doc:`its API <./api-v1>`.

The stats collection (from the FO to the stats node) can be triggered with a
`cron job <installation.html#integration-with-monarc-and-collect-of-the-stats>`__.


Scenario 2
''''''''''

.. image:: _static/architecture-stats-scenario2.png
   :alt: Stats Service API interaction with MONARC

In the company A, the difference is that Stats Service API (*stats*) is
installed on the same server where the MONARC back office is deployed. Not on
on a dedicated server. The server hosting the back office of MONARC is a good choice.



Scenario 3
''''''''''

.. image:: _static/architecture-stats-scenario3.png
   :alt: Stats Service API interaction with MONARC

*stats* collects data from the two MONARC front offices of the company B.
These aggregated data can be used for the dashboard for the CEO role of MONARC
client instances in this company. But also, in the future, for the MONARC back office.

     
Scenario 4
''''''''''

.. image:: _static/architecture-stats-scenario4.png

Wendy is simply connected to a MONARC front office deployed in a local
Virtual Box instance. Stats Service (*stats*) is running next to MONARC in this virtual
machine.


Important notes
---------------


.. note::

    In all scenario, **locally collected** statistics (in *stats* node)
    can optionally be sent to `dashboard.monarc.lu <https://dashboard.monarc.lu>`_ which is
    a global instance. It's the same software. You can configure the
    global dashboard statistics **sharing** option in the
    `General Settings / Sharing statistics  <https://www.monarc.lu/documentation/user-guide/#global-dashboard>`_
    view of your MONARC instance
    (`see here <https://www.monarc.lu/documentation/user-guide/images/GlobalDashboardGlobalSetting.png>`_).
    
    However, stats must always be collected in your local Stats Service instance.
    This is required for the proper functioning of the global dashboard of your MONARC instance. 


.. note::

    It is as well possible to run your own alternative to dashboard.monarc.lu. And then
    you can configure the variable *REMOTE_STATS_SERVER* of your local Stats Service
    instance with the address of your "global" instance.



Integration with external services
----------------------------------

MOSP

A Stats Service instance is able to query MOSP.
