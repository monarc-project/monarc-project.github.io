## Bug reports

The bug tracker is for tracking bugs, todos and confirmed new features.
If you want to submit a feature request please discuss about it here:
https://github.com/monarc-project/MonarcAppFO/discussions

Do not use the bug tracker to ask questions about how to use MONARC.

Please be aware of the following things when filing bug reports:

1. Avoid raising duplicate issues. Use the GitHub issue search feature
   to check whether your bug report has been mentioned in the past.
2. When filing bug reports about exceptions or tracebacks, please include the
   *complete* traceback (logs of Apache, etc.).
3. Make sure you provide a suitable amount of information. This
   means you should provide: **how to reproduce the issue**,
   **what you expected to happen**, **what actually happens**,
   **what version of MONARC you are using** and  **how you installed it**.

Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the pull request description clearly describes the problem and the
  solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

If the bug concerns a
[security issue](/community/vulnerability-disclosure).


## New feature requests

Ideas of new features should always be discussed.

Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

* Suggest and [discuss about your idea](https://github.com/monarc-project/MonarcAppFO/discussions/categories/ideas);
* Open a pull request if you have collected positive feedback and can implement it yourself.


## Contribution to the translations

If you are willing to improve the translations of MONARC or if MONARC is not
yet available in your language, you can help us via our
[internationalization platform](https://translate.monarc.lu/projects/monarc/).


## Contribution to the documentation

Contributions to the documentation are also always welcome.

Please uses
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
[MarkdownMode](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MarkdownMode) is of great help
for that. If you are using the ATOM editor, you should also find some Markdown
extensions.

Do not version binary files (*.docx* document, etc.). for the
documentation or anything else. It easier to follow the changes of plain text
files.

[Pandoc](http://pandoc.org) is a wonderful tool to convert files from one
markup format into another.
