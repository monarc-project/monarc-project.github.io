Title: What is MONARC?

__MONARC is a tool and a method allowing an optimised, precise and repeatable
risk assessment.__

Depending on its size and its security needs, organisations must react in the
most appropriate manner. Adopting good practices, taking the necessary measures
and adjusting them proportionally: all this is part of the process to ensure
information security. Most of all, it depends on performing a risk analysis on
a regular basis.

Although the profitability of the risk analysis approach is guaranteed, the
investment represented by this approach in terms of the required cost and
expertise is a barrier for many companies, especially SMEs.

To remedy this situation and allow all organisations, both large and small, to
benefit from the advantages that a risk analysis offers, CASES has developed an
optimised risk analysis method: [MONARC](https://github.com/monarc-project)
(**Optimised Risk Analysis Method**), allowing precise and repeatable risk
management.

The advantage of MONARC lies in the capitalisation of risk analysis already
performed in similar business contexts: the same vulnerabilities regularly
appear in many businesses, as they face the same threats and generate similar
risks. Most companies have servers, printers, a fleet of smartphones, Wi-Fi
antennas, etc. therefore the vulnerabilities and threats
are the same. It is therefore sufficient to generalise risk scenarios for these
assets (also called objects) by context and/or business.

## Phases of MONARC

<a name="Context" />
### 1. Context Establishment
The first step is to take stock of the context, challenges and priorities of the
company or organization that wishes to analyse its risks. This particularly
serves to identify key activities and critical processes of the business in
order to guide the risk analysis towards the most important elements. To do
this, a kick-off meeting is organized with the members of the management and key
individuals. The goal is to know what makes the company «live» and what could
destroy it, to identify the key processes, the internal and external threats as
well as organisational, technical and human vulnerabilities.


<a name="Modelling" />
### 2. Context Modelling
This phase includes the modelling of objects and trees. The assets were
identified in the previous phase. They must now be detailed and formalised in a
diagram that displays their interdependencies.

Impacts are defined at the level of the primary assets (processes or
information), following the information gathered in the context establishment
phase. The secondary assets inherit the impact of the primary asset to which
they are attached (object tree). The impact level of the secondary assets can be
modified manually.


<a name="Evaluation" />
### 3. Evaluation and treatment of risks
The assessment consists of quantifying the threats, vulnerabilities and impacts
in order to calculate the risks.

To do this, it is necessary to have quality information about the exact
likelihood of the threats, the ease of exploitation of vulnerabilities and
potential impacts; hence the need to rely on metrics that have been validated by
experts.  

When the risk assessment identifies a risk that is higher than the acceptable
level (risk acceptance grid), risk treatment measures should be implemented in
order to reduce the risk down to an acceptable level.


<a name="Implementation" />
### 4. Implementation and monitoring
When the first treatment of risks has been carried out, an ongoing management
phase with security monitoring and recurring control of security measures must
be entered, in order to improve it in a sustainable manner.

This fourth phase also allows to continuously optimise security by increasing
the detail of objects used and by expanding the scope of the risk analysis.
