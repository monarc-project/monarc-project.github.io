Summary: Release 2.4.2 of MONARC

Version 2.4.2 of MONARC has been released.

### Enhancement

- improvements for the breadcrumb used in the graphs of the dashboard. Moreover
  it is now possible to click in the items of the breadcrumb in order to
  navigate between the different graph's levels;
- the deadlines of recommendations are now set with a date picker in the fourth
  step ([#98](https://github.com/monarc-project/MonarcAppFO/issues/98));
- Removed the filter on the checkbox of the step 3 to display the dashboard of
  residual risk ([#99](https://github.com/monarc-project/MonarcAppFO/issues/99));
- the column 'phone' has been removed from the 'users' table and in the models.
  The application must store the minimum amount of information required on
  users;
- Validate recommendations for operational risks ([#102](https://github.com/monarc-project/MonarcAppFO/issues/102));
- the translations have been improved.

### Fix

- Operational risks are not updated ([#93](https://github.com/monarc-project/MonarcAppFO/issues/93));
- In the 4th deliverable, an inherited risk is displayed at -1 and in red
  color ([#100](https://github.com/monarc-project/MonarcAppFO/issues/100));
- Fixed a problem with some translations in the legends of the report's graphs;
- Removal of a recommendation on same risk of different assets of the same type
  ([#92](https://github.com/monarc-project/MonarcAppFO/issues/92)).
