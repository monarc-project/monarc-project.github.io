Presentation
============

`MONARC Stats Service <https://github.com/monarc-project/stats-service>`_ is a libre
software which is providing:

* an API in order to **collect** statistics from one or several
  `MONARC <https://github.com/monarc-project/MonarcAppFO>`_ instances and to **return**
  these statistics with different filters and aggregation methods;
* a dashboard that summarizes the **current cybersecurity landscape**. The charts are
  based on the collected statistics.

This software can be deployed just next to a MONARC instance or on a
dedicated server.

The collected statistics can be sent to an other Stats Service instance.

.. note::

    The public official instance operated by `NC3 <https://www.nc3.lu>`_ is
    available at `dashboard.monarc.lu <https://dashboard.monarc.lu>`_.
